This project contains code I wrote quite some time ago to get rid of the endless discussions about 
coverage including bean setters and getters in the measurements.
The simplest way to do this is by calling getter and setter, the setter with an arbitrary value of 
the type expected. 
Since this does not work in all cases, the setter e.g., having additional validation
code, properties can be excluded by name. In a second mode, only those properties given explicitly
are tested.
Here is an example:

        bmth = new BeanMethodTestHelper(oUT);
        bmth.excludeProperty("nothing");
        bmth.executeBeanMethods();


Enjoy it, Joachim
